**A pragmatic guide to designing and building RESTful APIs using Java**

## What is this book about?
Representational State Transfer (REST) is a simple yet powerful software architecture style to create lightweight and scalable web services. The RESTful web services use HTTP as the transport protocol and can use any message formats, including XML, JSON(widely used), CSV, and many more, which makes it easily inter-operable across different languages and platforms.

This book covers the following exciting features:

* Introduce yourself to the RESTful software architectural style and the REST API design principles 
* Make use of the JSR 353 API, JSR 374 API, JSR 367 API and Jackson API for JSON processing 
* Build portable RESTful web APIs, making use of the JAX-RS 2.1 API 
* Simplify API development using the Jersey and RESTEasy extension APIs 
* Secure your RESTful web services with various authentication and authorization mechanisms
